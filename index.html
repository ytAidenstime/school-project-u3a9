             During christmas break i enjoyed playing a variety of video games including black ops 6 (call of duty), minecraft, and many other games. 
             i also enjoyed spending time with family while we watched movies and played games. 
             i also worked on a new program that you can see an image of below! it is programmed in html, css, js and uses many frameworks some of which are nodejs (javascript runtime), expressjs (server framework), and reactjs (for the frontend).
